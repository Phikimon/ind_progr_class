main.c:

Following are the nodes of Linked List:
4294967295 155 16

obf.c:

[ 0]: ptr = 00691418, data = 16, nptr = 00691420
[ 1]: ptr = 00691420, data = 155, nptr = 00691428
[ 2]: ptr = 00691428, data = 4294967295, nptr = 00000000

Remark: output of main.c is reversed, because head of
        the list is located in the end of the array.
